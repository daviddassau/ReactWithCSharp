# Notes

```JavaScript
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>,
document.getElementById('app'));
```
In these lines of code, `ReactDOM` is the name of a JavaScript library. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another. The `.render` part is the most popular way to render JSX on the screen.
